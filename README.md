# Flying pigs

A reminder of a popular childhood game, with new and updated features
Simple to understand and very easy to play, having a small number of commands
An obvious proof of the multiple utilities and features offered by Python

# About the game

You are a farmer who needs to shoot the flying pigs in order to get the steak, sausages and ribs for your barbeque.
When being shot, the pigs turn into different kind of meat having different values of points (1, 2, respectively 3). 
The pigs will also shoot at you with life damaging poop.
At 50 points obtained, you can shoot with forks, and at 100 points with fireballs.
The game is over when you lost your lives. At first, you have 3 lives, but at every 40 points reached, you get another one.

# About the code
This game was made using Python 3 language and OOP concepts.
